# website

This is the PHP source code and CSS for the stevewpalmer.uk website. It is a very simple design comprising a header with an image and title, and a body showing the selected article. It is deliberately intended to be as minimalist as possible as the focus is only simply displaying a series of articles that render clearly and accessibly on any web browser.

The PHP source is, like the website, also deliberately minimalist. I have added some basic comments to make it understandable but the bulk of the code does little more than display the most recent article followed by a link that allows the user to iterate back through earlier articles based on their creation time. A person with little coding experience should, hopefully, be able to follow the logic. 

The source code is made available freely under the MIT licence which means that it is free to be re-used and adapted as needed.
